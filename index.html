<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Shaoying Ma. I am a Pelotonia Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Tobacco Research (CTR) within The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC).</p>
<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">I am a health economist and health policy researcher. Broadly, my research examines the impacts of health-related policies on individuals' behaviors. I received my PhD degree in Economics from The City University of New York Graduate Center (CUNY-GC) in September 2020, and joined OSUCCC and CTR in the same month. In the past I also worked as a research coordinator at the New York University (NYU) Perlmutter Cancer Center and the breast clinic of Bellevue Hospital.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">Since joining OSUCCC and CTR, my research has primarily focused on substance use behaviors and regulatory policies. My research has been published at leading peer-reviewed academic journals including <i>Tobacco Control</i>. I am funded by the Pelotonia Fellowship Program at OSUCCC to examine the disparities in nicotine/tobacco product (NTP) use among the sexual and gender diverse (SGD) populations in the US.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify"> <strong>Teaching:</strong> During my doctoral studies, I gained extensive teaching experience as instructor of record in two senior colleges within CUNY - Queens College and Hunter College. I developed syllabi and taught Economics courses to a total of ~400 undergraduate students, both majors and non-majors. Building upon my teaching experience, I designed a series of tutorials - <i>Math in Economics</i> Series, to help students in undergraduate economics courses with math basics. The tutorials are used in both Dolciani Mathematics Learning Center and Economics Tutoring Center of Hunter College, starting from Fall 2019 semester.</p>
