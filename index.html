<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Shaoying Ma. I am a Pelotonia Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Tobacco Research (CTR) within The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC).</p>
<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">I am a health economist and health policy researcher. Broadly, my research examines the impacts of health-related policies on individuals' behaviors. I received my PhD degree in Economics from The City University of New York Graduate Center (CUNY-GC) in September 2020, and joined OSUCCC and CTR in the same month. In the past I also worked as a research coordinator at the New York University (NYU) Perlmutter Cancer Center and the breast clinic of Bellevue Hospital.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">Since joining OSUCCC and CTR, my research has primarily focused on substance use behaviors and regulatory policies. My research has been published at leading peer-reviewed academic journals including <i>Tobacco Control</i>. I am funded by the Pelotonia Fellowship Program at OSUCCC to examine the disparities in nicotine/tobacco product (NTP) use among the sexual and gender diverse (SGD) populations in the US.</p>
